# LLM Capability Framework (LCF)

> A structural standard for mapping AI tasks to specific capability layers (L1-L6) to maximize reliability and deterministic fidelity.

## Core Documentation

* [README.md](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/m3dcodie/LLM-Capability-Framework-LCF/blob/main/README.md): The executive summary of the 6-layer architecture and the Scout-Auditor philosophy.
* [Layer 1: Data Extraction](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/m3dcodie/LLM-Capability-Framework-LCF/blob/main/1_Capability_Layers/layer_1_extraction.md): The standard for structural alignment. Defines the use of distilled models (Scouts) for zero-entropy mapping.

## Benchmarks & Validation

* [Resume Fidelity Test Analysis](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/m3dcodie/LLM-Capability-Framework-LCF/blob/main/benchmarks/L1_extraction/analysis.md): A comparative audit of Claude 4.5 Haiku vs. Gemini 3 Pro on unstructured data.

## Prompt Contracts

* [L1 Standard Contract](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/m3dcodie/prompt-contract): The hardened, deterministic prompt used for Layer 1 Scouts.

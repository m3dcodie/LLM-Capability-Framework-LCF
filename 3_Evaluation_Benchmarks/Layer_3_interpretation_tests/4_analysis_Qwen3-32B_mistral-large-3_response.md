## Layer 3 Analysis: The "Principal Gap" Case Study

**Auditor:** Mistral Large 3 (70B) & Qwen 3-32B

### The "Hidden Signal" Detection

Layer 3 successfully moved past the literal list of tools (AWS, Go, Rust) to analyze **Architectural Sovereignty**.

**Key Finding:** Both models identified that while technical complexity is high (75+ integrations), the **Outcome Ownership** is low.

- _Observation:_ The model flagged the lack of "P&L Impact" and "Regulatory Compliance (APRA)" as the primary ceiling preventing a $300k+ offer.

### Judgment Alignment (JA) Results

- **Mistral Score:** 78/100
- **Qwen Score:** 79/100
- **Consensus:** The candidate is a "Senior Staff" engineer being held back by a "Task-Oriented" narrative rather than a "Value-Oriented" one.

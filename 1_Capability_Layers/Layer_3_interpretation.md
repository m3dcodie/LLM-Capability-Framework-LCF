# Layer 3: Interpretation (The Strategist)

**Role:** **The Strategist / Analyst** **Objective:** **Judgment & Gap Analysis** — Moving from _what_ the data is to _what it means_ for a specific goal.  
**Success Metric:** **Judgment Alignment (JA)**.

## 1. Functional Definition

Layer 3 introduces **Subjectivity** into the LLM Capability Framework. It evaluates the clean data from Layers 1 & 2 against high-level market benchmarks, business goals, or psychological profiles.

## 2. Model Selection: The Logic-Heavy Reasoner (32B–70B)

Layer 3 requires models with high **Reasoning Density** and **Contextual Nuance**.

- **The Requirement:** Must support `<think>` tags (Chain-of-Thought) to expose logic.
- **LCF Benchmark Result (Feb 2026):** **Mistral Large 3** is the current "Subjective Standard." It successfully identified that a "Guinness World Record" is a novelty signal that can actually _dilute_ a Principal-level technical narrative if not framed strategically.

## 3. The Layer 3 Prompt Contract

Following the 5-layer framework, the L3 Contract forces the model to act as a **Skeptical Hiring Partner**.

- **Scope:** L2 Narrative + Target Goal (e.g., $250k Job).
- **Reasoning:** Forced CoT to evaluate "Invisible Signals" (Scale, Leadership, Foresight).
- **Language:** Direct, critical, and metric-focused.

## 4. Validation: Peer Review Alignment

Because there is no "correct" answer, validation is performed by comparing the "Readiness Scores" of two competing models (e.g., Mistral 70B vs Qwen 32B).

- **Pass:** Variance is < 5%.
- **Audit Required:** Variance > 10% (Requires a Layer 6 Director to adjudicate).

## 1. Core Standard: Layer 1 (Data Extraction)

**Role:** The Scout

**Objective:** Structural Alignment — Mapping unstructured noise to a deterministic protocol.

**Success Metric:** Schema Adherence Rate (SAR) & Entity Extraction Rate (EER).

### Functional Definition

Layer 1 is the **System's Sensory Gateway**. Its purpose is to eliminate "Natural Language Entropy" by forcing input into a repeatable, typed structure (JSON, TOON, CSV, or YAML).

### Model Selection: The Scout Principle

LCF mandates the use of **Distilled Models (4B-14B)** for Layer 1.

* **The Intelligence Paradox:** Large reasoning models (Directors) often suffer from "Agentic Laziness" or "Summarization Bias," leading to data loss.
* **The Scout Advantage:** Models like **Claude 4.5 Haiku** treat Prompt Contracts as rigid code constraints, resulting in higher data density and lower latency.

### Implementation Patterns

1. **The Sequential Pipeline (Scout-Auditor):** Pass 1 (The Scout) performs high-speed literal extraction. Pass 2 (The Auditor) uses a larger model to check logic.
2. **The Intelligence Cascade:** A "Director" model maps document boundaries and delegates specific "work packages" to multiple "Scout" models for parallel processing.

## 2. Validation: Resume Fidelity Benchmark

**Test Case:** M Suhail Tahir CV (3-page complex PDF)

**Models:** Claude 4.5 Haiku vs. Gemini 3 Pro

### Comparative Findings

* **Claude 4.5 Haiku:** 11s TTFT | 100% Schema Adherence | 22+ Entities Extracted.
* **Gemini 3 Pro:** 11s TTFT | 92% Schema Adherence | 6 Entities Extracted (Summarized).

### Technical Insight: "Context Awareness"

Claude 4.5 Haiku utilizes explicit **Context Awareness**. It identifies its available token budget and uses it to perform high-density extraction, capturing granular technical signals (e.g., individual AWS services) that larger models prematurely "summarize" due to agentic laziness.

## 3. The L1 Prompt Contract (Standard)

```markdown
## STRICT EXTRACTION PROTOCOL:
- PERCEPTION: You are a literalist data-entry machine. 
- NO SUMMARIZATION: Every bullet point in the source must be its own string in a list. DO NOT aggregate duties.
- ZERO CONVERSATION: Output the JSON object ONLY. No preambles.
- ENTITY PRESERVATION: Use the exact text found. Do not "improve" titles.

```

## 4. Philosophical Foundation (Manifesto)

The LCF is built on the belief that **Deterministic Architecture** is the bridge between human intent and machine execution.

* **The Scout** moves the earth (data alignment).
* **The Architect** builds the sky (reasoning/agency).
By ensuring Layer 1 is a "Zero-Entropy" zone, we enable the higher layers to reason over facts, not hallucinations.
